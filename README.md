# Self-Portrait-as-Software
<p> before downloading know that here, joy and gentleness is celebrated.
<p> if too much information is thrown at this software without any visual or audio references the software processing speed will slow right down and might over heat - break
<p> this software may spontaneously start singing, dancing, humming ... For best results, please do join in with the party
<p> everyone is welcome here. never be afraid to ask this software questions, questions, to re-explain something, turn it inside out, clarify, talk, there is always a way that we can find a way to be on the same page. 
<p> this software may ask you questions too. it is very curious and wants to have conversations. if you find this uncomfortable, let us celebrate our boundaries and speak as much or as little as we feel we need 
<p> this software has a tendency to think through speaking, bear with this, some clarity will hopefully come 
<p> this software responds well to encouragement, positivity and ** constructive ** feedback from a place of loving kindness 
<p> this software hopes to strive to create a world where * art * is more accessible to all the creatives out there that do not get provided with the same tools or opportunity that this software has 
<p> this software exists within a priviliged space. its aim is to break down walls and barriers  
<p> this software's dream is that our world continues to be filled with abundant love of community and kindness.
